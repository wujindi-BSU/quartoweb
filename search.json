    "text": "Hi,I’m Wu jindi\n\n\n\nmypicture\n\n\n\nMy Background\nAs a first-year graduate student of Educational Management at Belarusian State University, my academic journey has been deeply influenced by my prior experience as a psychology teacher, where I developed a profound passion for the field of education.My research interests are centred on the application of positive psychology in educational management, with a particular focus on innovative practices that promote positive emotions, positive organisations and positive environments.\nI believe that, by employing the principles of positive psychology, we can enhance our understanding of and improve educational environments, thereby facilitating the optimal development of students’ potential and well-being.\nIn addition to my academic pursuits at GBS, I have been actively engaged in voluntary work for the past six years, primarily in the domains of teaching and tutoring during the winter and summer vacation periods. This engagement has not only facilitated the practical application of my psychological knowledge but also enriched my understanding of the importance of positive psychology in educational management.\nIt has become evident that my interests lie more in research and teaching, and the experience I have gained from volunteering reinforces the importance of positive psychology in shaping a positive managerial and social atmosphere. Consequently, my current goal is to complete my graduate studies, continue my doctoral studies, and eventually pursue a career as a college teacher.\n\n\nExperience\nThe focus of my own independent research is the role and innovation of positive psychology in educational management with a view to enhancing teacher well-being, formulating a more stable “psychological contract” and reducing staff turnover. The research revolves around positive environments, positive organisations and positive emotions. It was this project that prompted me to use R to perform some secondary data analysis. Thus far, I have used R to create simple graphs such as scatter plots, box plots and bar graphs.\n\n\nCourse Goals\nMy experience in R has revolved around accomplishing a few very specific tasks, and my “workflow” usually involves a lot of Googling. My goals for this class are to:\n\nCome away with the knowledge and skills to approach a wide set of problems and tasks using R\nPractice a clean and organized method of performing data analyses\nimprove the data analysis of my research project on positive psychology in education management in Chinese universities and create aesthetically pleasing, publishable data\nUnderstand the mechanisms of action and influencing factors of positive psychology, and better understand how the raw data was eventually transformed into experimental data for my master’s thesis.\nGet familiar with predictive modeling/machine learning\n\n\n\nHobbies & Fun Facts\nI am a member of the Guangzhou Hiking Club and also enjoy tennis and making Chinese non-heritage cultural crafts. I enjoy every moment of my life, whether it’s hiking outdoors, sweating on the court, or immersing myself in the charm of traditional Chinese culture.\nI hope that studying at Belarusian State University will be an exciting experience in life, not only in terms of learning professional knowledge, but also in terms of cross-cultural exchange and experience of local customs!\nI like to ‘city walk’ in Belarus because photography and reading are an integral part of my life. I love to capture beautiful moments in life with my camera, whether it’s a natural landscape, a cityscape or a portrait, photography allows me to see the world from different perspectives and develops my aesthetic and creativity. Reading is a source of knowledge and inspiration for me. Whether it’s literature, psychological monographs or scientific articles, books always bring me new inspirations and thoughts."

    "text": "This chapter will take you through some of the essential parts of a Python workflow.\nPrerequisites You’ll need an installation of Python and Visual Studio Code with the Python extensions to get to grips with this chapter. If you haven’t installed those yet, head back to {ref}code-preliminaries and follow the instructions there.\nWorking with Python scripts and the interactive window As a reminder, the figure below shows the typical layout of Visual Studio Code.\nA typical user view in Visual Studio Code\nWhen you create a new script (File-&gt;New File-&gt;Save as ’your_script_name.py), it will appear in the part of the screen labelled as 3.\nTo run a script, select the code you want to run, right click, and select “Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window”. You can also hit shift + enter if you set this shortcut up; if you haven’t it’s well worth doing and you can find the instructions in {ref}code-preliminaries.\nUsing the “Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window” option or using the shortcut will cause panel 5 in the above diagram (the interactive window) to appear, where you will see the code run and the outputs of your script appear.\n{tip} If you have an issue getting the code to run in the interactive window, first check the instructions in {ref}code-preliminaries. If you’re still having issues, it may be that Visual Studio Code isn’t sure which Python to run, or where Python is on your system. To fix the latter problem, hit the “Select kernel” button in the top right-hand side of the interactive window. When you are first writing a script, it’s useful to be able to move back and forth between the script and the interactive window. You might execute a line of code (put the cursor on the relevant line and hit shift and enter) in the interactive window, then manually write out some code in the interactive window’s execution box (seen at the bottom of panel 5 saying “Type code here…”), and then explore some of the variables you’ve created with the variable explorer (using the button “Variables”) at the top of the interactive window.\nBut, once you’ve honed the code in your script, it’s good to make the script a complete analytical process that you are happy running end-to-end and that—for production or ‘final’ work—you would use the “Run Current File in Interactive Window” option to run all the way through. This is good practice because what is in your script is reproducible but what you’ve entered manually in the interactive window is not. And you want the outputs from your code to be reproducible and understandable by others (including future you!), but this is hard if there are undocumented extra lines of code that you only did on the fly via the interactive window’s execution box.\nUsing installed packages and modules We already saw how to install packages in {ref}code-preliminaries. If you forgot, look back at how to do this now. In short, packages are installed using the command line or, on Windows, the Anaconda prompt. With either of these open, type conda install packagename and hit enter to both search for and install the package you need.\nWhat about using a package that you’ve installed? That’s what we’ll look at now.\nLet’s see an example of using the powerful numerical library numpy. There are different ways to import packages to use within a script or notebook; you can import the entire package in one go or just import the functions you need (if you know their names). When an entire package is imported, you can give it any name you like and the convention for numpy is to import it as the shortened ‘np’. All of the functions and methods of the package can be accessed by typing np followed by . and then typing the function name. This convention of importing packages with a given name makes your code easier to read, because you know exactly which package is doing what, and avoids any conflicts when functions from different packages have the same name.\nAs well as demonstrating importing the whole package for numpy, the example below shows importing just one specific function from numpy, inv, which does matrix inversion. Note that because inv was imported separately it can be used without an np prefix.\nimport numpy as np from numpy.linalg import inv\nmatrix = np.array([[4.0, 2.0, 4.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])\nprint(“Matrix:”) print(matrix)\ninv_mat = inv(matrix) print(“Inverse:”) print(inv_mat) We could have imported all of numpy and it used it without extension using from numpy import * but this is considered bad practice as it fills our ‘namespace’ with function names that might clash with other packages and it’s less easy to read because you don’t know which function came from which package (one of Python’s mantras is “explicit is better than implict”). However, some packages are designed to be used like this, so, for example, you will see from lets_plot import * in this book.\n{note} If you want to check what packages you have installed in your Python environment, run conda list on your computer’s command line (aka the terminal or command prompt). Sometimes you might forget what a function you have imported does! Or at least, you might not be sure what all of the optional arguments are. In Visual Studio Code, you can just hover your cursor over the name of the function and a box will come up that tells you everything you need to know about it. This box is auto-generated by doc-strings; information that is written in text just under a function’s definition (def statement).\nAn alternative way to see what a function does is to use a wonderful package called rich that does many things including providing an inspect() function. You will need to use pip to install rich by running pip install rich on the command line. Here’s an example of using rich’s inpsect method on the inv() function we imported above (methods=True reports all of the functionality of inv()):\nfrom rich import inspect\ninspect(inv, help=True) {admonition} Write a code block that imports the numpy function numpy.linalg.det() as det(). Run inspect() on it. Find the determinant of [[4, 3], [1, 7]]. Modules Sometimes, you will want to call in some code from a different script that you wrote (rather than from a package provided by someone else). Imagine you have several scripts with code in, a, b, and c, all of which need to use the same underlying function that you have written. What do you do? (Note that “script with code in” is just a text file that has a .py extension and contains code.)\nA central tenet of good coding is that you do not repeat yourself. Therefore, a bad solution to this problem would be to copy and paste the same code into all three of the scripts. A good solution is to write the code that’s need just once in a separate ‘utility’ script and have the other scripts import that one function. This also adheres to another important programming principle: that of writing modular code.\nThis schematic shows the kind of situation we’re talking about:\nimport networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib_inline.backend_inline\n\n\n\nplt.style.use( “https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists/raw/main/plot_style.txt” ) matplotlib_inline.backend_inline.set_matplotlib_formats(“svg”)\ngraph = nx.DiGraph() graph.add_edges_from( [ (“Utility script”, “code file a”), (“Utility script”, “code file b”), (“code file a”, “code file c”), (“code file b”, “code file c”), (“Utility script”, “code file c”), ] ) colour_node = “#AFCBFF” fixed_pos = nx.spring_layout(graph, seed=100) nx.draw(graph, pos=fixed_pos, with_labels=True, node_size=6000, node_color=colour_node) extent = 1.4 plt.xlim(-extent, extent) plt.ylim(-extent, extent) plt.show(); How can we give code files a, b, and c access to the functions etc in the “Utility script”? We would define a file ‘utilities.py’ that had the following function in that we would like to use in the other code files:\n\n\n\ndef really_useful_func(number): return number*10 Then, in ‘code_script_a.py’, we would write:\nimport utilities as utils\nprint(utils.really_useful_func(20)) An alternative is to just import the function we want, with the name we want:\nfrom utilities import really_useful_func as ru_fn\nprint(ru_fn(30)) Another important example is the case where you want to run ‘utilities.py’ as a standalone script, but still want to borrow functions from it to run in other scripts. There’s a way to do this. Let’s change utilities.py to\n\n\n\ndef really_useful_func(number): return number*10\ndef default_func(): print(‘Script has run’)\nif name == ‘main’: default_func() What this says is that if we call ‘utilities.py’ from the command line, eg\npython utilities.py It will return Script has run because, by executing the script alone, we are asking for anything in the main block defined at the end of the file to be run. But we can still import anything from utilities into other scripts as before–and in that case it is not the main script, but an import, and so the main block will not be executed by default.\nYou can important several functions at once from a module (aka another script file) like this:\nfrom utilities import really_useful_func, default_func {admonition} Write your own utilities.py that has a super_useful_func that accepts a number and returns the number divided by 10. In another script, main.py, try a) importing all of utilities and running super_useful_func on a number and, b), importing just super_useful_func from utilities and running it on a number. Reading and writing files Although most applications in economics will use the pandas package to read and write tabular data, it’s sometimes useful to know how to read and write arbitrary files using the built-in Python libraries too. To open a file\nopen(‘filename’, mode) where mode could be r for read, a for append, w for write, and x to create a file. Create a file called text_example.txt and write a single line in it, ‘hello world’. To open the file and print the text, use:\nwith open(‘text_example.txt’) as f: text_in = f.read()\nprint(text_in) ‘hello world!’ is the new line character. Now let’s try adding a line to the file:\nwith open(‘text_example.txt’, ‘a’) as f: f.write(‘this is another line’) Writing and reading files using the with command is a quick and convenient shorthand for the less concise open, action, close pattern. For example, the above example can also be written as:\nf = open(‘text_example.txt’, ‘a’) f.write(‘this is another line’) f.close() Although this short example shows opening and writing a text file, this approach can be used to edit a wide range of file extensions including .json, .xml, .csv, .tsv, and many more, including binary files in addition to plain text files.\n\n\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"seattle_pet_licenses.csv\")\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanimal_s_name\nlicense_issue_date\nlicense_number\nprimary_breed\nsecondary_breed\nspecies\nzip_code\n\n\n\n\n0\nOzzy\n2005-03-29T00:00:00.000\n130651.0\nDachshund, Standard Smooth Haired\nNaN\nDog\n98104\n\n\n1\nJack\n2009-12-23T00:00:00.000\n898148.0\nSchnauzer, Miniature\nTerrier, Rat\nDog\n98107\n\n\n2\nGinger\n2006-01-20T00:00:00.000\n29654.0\nRetriever, Golden\nRetriever, Labrador\nDog\n98117\n\n\n3\nPepper\n2006-02-07T00:00:00.000\n75432.0\nManx\nMix\nCat\n98103\n\n\n4\nAddy\n2006-08-04T00:00:00.000\n729899.0\nRetriever, Golden\nNaN\nDog\n98105\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n66037\nLily\n2016-12-27T00:00:00.000\nNaN\nDomestic Shorthair\nMix\nCat\n98117\n\n\n66038\nEllie\n2016-11-29T00:00:00.000\nNaN\nGerman Shepherd\nMix\nDog\n98105\n\n\n66039\nSammy\n2016-12-05T00:00:00.000\nNaN\nTerrier\nMaltese\nDog\n98105\n\n\n66040\nBuddy\n2016-12-06T00:00:00.000\nNaN\nBullmastiff\nMix\nDog\n98105\n\n\n66041\nAku\n2016-12-07T00:00:00.000\nNaN\nChihuahua, Short Coat\nTerrier\nDog\n98106\n\n\n\n\n66042 rows × 7 columns\n\n\n\nQuestions:How many pets are included in this dataset?

'continent'])\n\nQuenstion1:Plot, using histograms, the distribution of plastic waste per capita faceted by continent. What can you say about how the continents compare to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita? The answer:With the histogram, it is possible to observe differences in the per capita distribution of plastic waste across continents. For example, Africa shows a higher peak waste output and North America shows a wider distribution.\n\n# Create histograms faceted by continent\np_histogram = ggplot(df_clean, aes(x='plastic_waste_per_cap')) + \\\n    geom_histogram(bins=30, fill='blue', color='black', alpha=0.7) + \\\n    facet_wrap('continent') + \\\n    ggtitle('Distribution of Plastic Waste per Capita by Continent') + \\\n    xlab('Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n    ylab('Frequency')\n\n\np_histogram.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\nQuenstion2:Convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to violin plots. What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots? The answer:Fiddle plots show the complete distribution of the data, showing the shape of the data and multiple peaks in the graph. Box plots provide explicit statistical information that violin plots only reflect through shape.\n\n# Violin plots\np_violin = ggplot(df, aes(x='continent', y='plastic_waste_per_cap', fill='continent')) + \\\n    geom_violin(alpha=0.7) + \\\n    geom_boxplot(width=0.1, fill='white', color='black') + \\\n    ggtitle('Violin Plot of Plastic Waste per Capita by Continent') + \\\n    xlab('Continent') + \\\n    ylab('Plastic Waste per Capita')\n\np_violin.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\nQuenstion3:Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita using a scatterplot. Describe the relationship. The answer:The scatter plot presents the relationship between plastic waste per capita and poorly managed waste per capita, checking if there is a positive or other relationship.\n\n# Scatterplot\nif 'mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap' in df.columns:\n    p_scatter = ggplot(df, aes(x='plastic_waste_per_cap', y='mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap')) + \\\n        geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.6) + \\\n        ggtitle('Plastic Waste vs. Mismanaged Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n        xlab('Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n        ylab('Mismanaged Plastic Waste per Capita')\n    \n    p_scatter.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\nQuenstion4:Colour the points in the scatterplot by continent. Does there seem to be any clear distinctions between continents with respect to how plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita are associated? The answer:By distinguishing continents by color, it is possible to observe differences between continents. Certain continents may exhibit specific patterns or clusters, such as the gradual rise of Africa.\n\n# Colored scatterplot\np_scatter_colored = ggplot(df, aes(x='plastic_waste_per_cap', y='mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap', color='continent')) + \\\n    geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.6) + \\\n    ggtitle('Plastic Waste vs. Mismanaged Plastic Waste per Capita by Continent') + \\\n    xlab('Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n    ylab('Mismanaged Plastic Waste per Capita')\n\np_scatter_colored.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\nQuenstion5:Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and total population as well as plastic waste per capita and coastal population. You will need to make two separate plots. Do either of these pairs of variables appear to be more strongly linearly associated? The answer:The visualization of the relationship between the two demographic variables shows the association between plastic waste per capita and total population and coastal population. Through scatterplot analysis, plastic waste per capita exhibits a stronger linear relationship with coastal population.\n\n# Plastic waste per capita vs Total population\np_pop_scatter = ggplot(df, aes(x='plastic_waste_per_cap', y='total_pop', color='continent')) + \\\n    geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.6) + \\\n    ggtitle('Plastic Waste per Capita vs. Total Population') + \\\n    xlab('Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n    ylab('Total Population')\n\np_pop_scatter.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\n\n# Plastic waste per capita vs Coastal population\np_coastal_scatter = ggplot(df, aes(x='plastic_waste_per_cap', y='coastal_pop', color='continent')) + \\\n    geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.6) + \\\n    ggtitle('Plastic Waste per Capita vs. Coastal Population') + \\\n    xlab('Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n    ylab('Coastal Population')\n\np_coastal_scatter.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\n\np_coastal_scatter = ggplot(df, aes(x='coastal_pop', y='plastic_waste_per_cap', color='continent')) + \\\n    geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.6) + \\\n    ggtitle('Coastal Population vs. Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n    xlab('coastal pop') + \\\n    ylab('plastic waste per cap')\n\np_coastal_scatter.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\n\np_coastal_scatter.show()\ndf['coastal_population_proportion'] = df['coastal_pop'] / df['total_pop']\ndf_filtered = df\ndf_filtered = df_filtered[(df_filtered['plastic_waste_per_cap'] &lt;= 0.6) & \n(df_filtered['coastal_population_proportion'] &lt;= 1.6)]\np_scatter = ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x='coastal_population_proportion', y='plastic_waste_per_cap', color='continent')) + \\\n    geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.7) + \\\n    geom_smooth(method='lm', color='black', se=True, linetype='solid', size=1) + \\\n    ggtitle('Plastic Waste per Capita vs Coastal Population Proportion') + \\\n    xlab('Coastal Population Proportion') + \\\n    ylab('Plastic Waste per Capita')\n\n\np_scatter.show()"

What can you say about how the continents compare to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita? The answer:With the histogram, it is possible to observe differences in the per capita distribution of plastic waste across continents. For example, Africa shows a higher peak waste output and North America shows a wider distribution.\n\n# Create histograms faceted by continent\np_histogram = ggplot(df_clean, aes(x='plastic_waste_per_cap')) + \\\n    geom_histogram(bins=30, fill='blue', color='black', alpha=0.7) + \\\n    facet_wrap('continent') + \\\n    ggtitle('Distribution of Plastic Waste per Capita by Continent') + \\\n    xlab('Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n    ylab('Frequency')\n\n\np_histogram.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\nQuenstion2:Convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to violin plots. What do the violin plots reveal that box plots do not? What features are apparent in the box plots but not in the violin plots? The answer:Fiddle plots show the complete distribution of the data, showing the shape of the data and multiple peaks in the graph. Box plots provide explicit statistical information that violin plots only reflect through shape.\n\n# Violin plots\np_violin = ggplot(df, aes(x='continent', y='plastic_waste_per_cap', fill='continent')) + \\\n    geom_violin(alpha=0.7) + \\\n    geom_boxplot(width=0.1, fill='white', color='black') + \\\n    ggtitle('Violin Plot of Plastic Waste per Capita by Continent') + \\\n    xlab('Continent') + \\\n    ylab('Plastic Waste per Capita')\n\np_violin.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\nQuenstion3:Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita using a scatterplot. Describe the relationship. The answer:The scatter plot presents the relationship between plastic waste per capita and poorly managed waste per capita, checking if there is a positive or other relationship.\n\n# Scatterplot\nif 'mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap' in df.columns:\n    p_scatter = ggplot(df, aes(x='plastic_waste_per_cap', y='mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap')) + \\\n        geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.6) + \\\n        ggtitle('Plastic Waste vs. Mismanaged Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n        xlab('Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n        ylab('Mismanaged Plastic Waste per Capita')\n    \n    p_scatter.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\nQuenstion4:Colour the points in the scatterplot by continent. Does there seem to be any clear distinctions between continents with respect to how plastic waste per capita and mismanaged plastic waste per capita are associated? The answer:By distinguishing continents by color, it is possible to observe differences between continents. Certain continents may exhibit specific patterns or clusters, such as the gradual rise of Africa.\n\n# Colored scatterplot\np_scatter_colored = ggplot(df, aes(x='plastic_waste_per_cap', y='mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap', color='continent')) + \\\n    geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.6) + \\\n    ggtitle('Plastic Waste vs. Mismanaged Plastic Waste per Capita by Continent') + \\\n    xlab('Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n    ylab('Mismanaged Plastic Waste per Capita')\n\np_scatter_colored.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\nQuenstion5:Visualize the relationship between plastic waste per capita and total population as well as plastic waste per capita and coastal population. You will need to make two separate plots. Do either of these pairs of variables appear to be more strongly linearly associated? The answer:The visualization of the relationship between the two demographic variables shows the association between plastic waste per capita and total population and coastal population. Through scatterplot analysis, plastic waste per capita exhibits a stronger linear relationship with coastal population.\n\n# Plastic waste per capita vs Total population\np_pop_scatter = ggplot(df, aes(x='plastic_waste_per_cap', y='total_pop', color='continent')) + \\\n    geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.6) + \\\n    ggtitle('Plastic Waste per Capita vs. Total Population') + \\\n    xlab('Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n    ylab('Total Population')\n\np_pop_scatter.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\n\n# Plastic waste per capita vs Coastal population\np_coastal_scatter = ggplot(df, aes(x='plastic_waste_per_cap', y='coastal_pop', color='continent')) + \\\n    geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.6) + \\\n    ggtitle('Plastic Waste per Capita vs. Coastal Population') + \\\n    xlab('Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n    ylab('Coastal Population')\n\np_coastal_scatter.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\n\np_coastal_scatter = ggplot(df, aes(x='coastal_pop', y='plastic_waste_per_cap', color='continent')) + \\\n    geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.6) + \\\n    ggtitle('Coastal Population vs. Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n    xlab('coastal pop') + \\\n    ylab('plastic waste per cap')\n\np_coastal_scatter.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\n\np_coastal_scatter.show()\ndf['coastal_population_proportion'] = df['coastal_pop'] / df['total_pop']\ndf_filtered = df\ndf_filtered = df_filtered[(df_filtered['plastic_waste_per_cap'] &lt;= 0.6) & \n(df_filtered['coastal_population_proportion'] &lt;= 1.6)]\np_scatter = ggplot(df_filtered, aes(x='coastal_population_proportion', y='plastic_waste_per_cap', color='continent')) + \\\n    geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.7) + \\\n    geom_smooth(method='lm', color='black', se=True, linetype='solid', size=1) + \\\n    ggtitle('Plastic Waste per Capita vs Coastal Population Proportion') + \\\n    xlab('Coastal Population Proportion') + \\\n    ylab('Plastic Waste per Capita')\n\n\np_scatter.show()"

Why have researchers chosen this particular measure over other measures (such as absolute temperature)? The answer: (1)A temperature “anomaly” is typically defined as a temperature that falls outside the normal range or expected value, suggesting the potential for an underlying issue or change. In contrast, absolute temperature represents the average kinetic energy of molecular motion and is expressed in Kelvins (K).

(For example, are the horizontal and vertical axes variables the same, or do the lines have the same shape?) The answer: (1)Similaritie:The temperature changes with time, and the overall trend is upward. (2)Differences:The horizontal and vertical axis variables of the two tables are different. For example, in 2000, Figure 1.4 shows a temperature of 0.5 and Figure 1.5 shows a temperature of 0.6. Questions:Looking at the behaviour of temperature over time from 1000 to 1900 in Figure 1.4, are the observed patterns in your chart unusual? The answer:From 1000 to 1900, the temperature fluctuate up and down with time, but the maximum value did not exceed 0.0, which indicates that the temperature change during this period was relatively small compared to the significant increase in industrial temperature after 1900, which I think is normal.\nQuestions:Based on your answers to Questions 4 and 5, do you think the government should be concerned about climate change? The answer:My point of view is that according to the chart data, the temperature is rising, which is a sign of global warming, so the government should pay attention to climate change.\n\ndf[\"Period\"] = pd.cut(\n    df.index,\n    bins=[1921, 1950, 1980, 2010],\n    labels=[\"1921—1950\", \"1951—1980\", \"1981—2010\"],\n    ordered=True,\n)\ndf[\"Period\"].tail(20)\n\nYear\n2005    1981—2010\n2006    1981—2010\n2007    1981—2010\n2008    1981—2010\n2009    1981—2010\n2010    1981—2010\n2011          NaN\n2012          NaN\n2013          NaN\n2014          NaN\n2015          NaN\n2016          NaN\n2017          NaN\n2018          NaN\n2019          NaN\n2020          NaN\n2021          NaN\n2022          NaN\n2023          NaN\n2024          NaN\nName: Period, dtype: category\nCategories (3, object): ['1921—1950' &lt; '1951—1980' &lt; '1981—2010']\n\n\n\nlist_of_months = [\"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\"]\ndf[list_of_months].stack().head()\n\nYear     \n1880  Jun   -0.18\n      Jul   -0.22\n      Aug   -0.25\n1881  Jun   -0.34\n      Jul    0.09\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=3, figsize=(9, 4), sharex=True, sharey=True)\nfor ax, period in zip(axes, df[\"Period\"].dropna().unique()):\n    df.loc[df[\"Period\"] == period, list_of_months].stack().hist(ax=ax)\n    ax.set_title(period)\nplt.suptitle(\"Histogram of temperature anomalies\")\naxes[1].set_xlabel(\"Summer temperature distribution\")\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a variable that has years 1951 to 1980, and months Jan to Dec (inclusive)\ntemp_all_months = df.loc[(df.index &gt;= 1951) & (df.index &lt;= 1980), \"Jan\":\"Dec\"]\n# Put all the data in stacked format and give the new columns sensible names\ntemp_all_months = (\n    temp_all_months.stack()\n    .reset_index()\n    .rename(columns={\"level_1\": \"month\", 0: \"values\"})\n)\n# Take a look at this data:\ntemp_all_months\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nmonth\nvalues\n\n\n\n\n0\n1951\nJan\n-0.36\n\n\n1\n1951\nFeb\n-0.51\n\n\n2\n1951\nMar\n-0.18\n\n\n3\n1951\nApr\n0.06\n\n\n4\n1951\nMay\n0.17\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n355\n1980\nAug\n0.10\n\n\n356\n1980\nSep\n0.10\n\n\n357\n1980\nOct\n0.12\n\n\n358\n1980\nNov\n0.21\n\n\n359\n1980\nDec\n0.09\n\n\n\n\n360 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\n\nquantiles = [0.3, 0.7]\nlist_of_percentiles = np.quantile(temp_all_months[\"values\"], q=quantiles)\n\nprint(f\"The cold threshold of {quantiles[0]*100}% is {list_of_percentiles[0]}\")\nprint(f\"The hot threshold of {quantiles[1]*100}% is {list_of_percentiles[1]}\")\n\nThe cold threshold of 30.0% is -0.1\nThe hot threshold of 70.0% is 0.1\n\n\n\n# Create a variable that has years 1981 to 2010, and months Jan to Dec (inclusive)\ntemp_all_months = df.loc[(df.index &gt;= 1981) & (df.index &lt;= 2010), \"Jan\":\"Dec\"]\n# Put all the data in stacked format and give the new columns sensible names\ntemp_all_months = (\n    temp_all_months.stack()\n    .reset_index()\n    .rename(columns={\"level_1\": \"month\", 0: \"values\"})\n)\n# Take a look at the start of this data data:\ntemp_all_months.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nmonth\nvalues\n\n\n\n\n0\n1981\nJan\n0.80\n\n\n1\n1981\nFeb\n0.62\n\n\n2\n1981\nMar\n0.68\n\n\n3\n1981\nApr\n0.39\n\n\n4\n1981\nMay\n0.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nentries_less_than_q30 = temp_all_months[\"values\"] &lt; list_of_percentiles[0]\nproportion_under_q30 = entries_less_than_q30.mean()\nprint(\n    f\"The proportion under {list_of_percentiles[0]} is {proportion_under_q30*100:.2f}%\"\n)\n\nThe proportion under -0.1 is 1.94%\n\n\n\nproportion_over_q70 = (temp_all_months[\"values\"] &gt; list_of_percentiles[1]).mean()\nprint(f\"The proportion over {list_of_percentiles[1]} is {proportion_over_q70*100:.2f}%\")\n\nThe proportion over 0.1 is 84.72%\n\n\n\ntemp_all_months = (\n    df.loc[:, \"DJF\":\"SON\"]\n    .stack()\n    .reset_index()\n    .rename(columns={\"level_1\": \"Season\", 0: \"Values\"})\n)\ntemp_all_months[\"Period\"] = pd.cut(\n    temp_all_months[\"Year\"],\n    bins=[1921, 1950, 1980, 2010],\n    labels=[\"1921—1950\", \"1951—1980\", \"1981—2010\"],\n    ordered=True,\n)\n# Take a look at a cut of the data using `.iloc`, which provides position\ntemp_all_months.iloc[-135:-125]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nSeason\nValues\nPeriod\n\n\n\n\n445\n1991\nMAM\n0.45\n1981—2010\n\n\n446\n1991\nJJA\n0.42\n1981—2010\n\n\n447\n1991\nSON\n0.32\n1981—2010\n\n\n448\n1992\nDJF\n0.43\n1981—2010\n\n\n449\n1992\nMAM\n0.29\n1981—2010\n\n\n450\n1992\nJJA\n-0.04\n1981—2010\n\n\n451\n1992\nSON\n-0.15\n1981—2010\n\n\n452\n1993\nDJF\n0.37\n1981—2010\n\n\n453\n1993\nMAM\n0.31\n1981—2010\n\n\n454\n1993\nJJA\n0.12\n1981—2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions:Calculate the mean (average) and variance separately for the following time periods: 1921–1950, 1951–1980, and 1981–2010.

Would you advise the government to spend more money on mitigating the effects of extreme weather events? The answer:As temperatures change more over time due to global warming, heat extremes are becoming more frequent and damaging. First, I suggest that the government should spend more money to alleviate the impact of extreme weather events on people’s lives, such as expanding the urban green area. Second, we will advocate low-carbon travel and life for the people.\n\ndf_co2 = pd.read_csv(r\"1_C02-data.csv\")\ndf_co2.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nMonth\nMonthly

relationship between CO2 levels and temperature anomalies?\nThe answer:CO2 levels and temperature have strongly correlated with each other. Questions:Consider the example of spurious correlation described above. Questions:(1)In your own words, explain spurious correlation and the difference between correlation and causation.\nThe answer:Spurious correlation: When two things seem linked but aren’t really, often due to a hidden factor.Correlation vs causation: Correlation shows a link, but causation means one thing causes another.\nQuestions:(2)Give an example of spurious correlation, similar to the one above, for either CO2 levels or temperature anomalies.\nThe answer: Example: CO2 Levels and Stock Market Performance.It might seem that there’s a correlation between rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere and improved stock market performance. However, this doesn’t mean that CO2 levels are directly causing the stock market to rise. Instead, both could be influenced by a common factor, such as economic growth. As economies grow, they often emit more CO2 and also tend to have better stock market performance.\nQuestions:(3)Choose an example of spurious correlation from Tyler Vigen’s website. Explain whether you think it is a coincidence, or whether this correlation could be due to one or more other variables.\nThe answer:An example is the correlation between the number of Nicolas Cage films released in a year and the number of people who die by falling into swimming pools.Is it a coincidence?Yes, it is likely a coincidence.Could it be due to one or more other variables?It could be due to the fact that both of these events are influenced by broader societal trends or random fluctuations that are not directly related to each other. For instance, the number of Nicolas Cage films released might be influenced by the film industry’s production schedule, while the number of swimming pool accidents could be influenced by factors such as weather conditions, safety regulations, and public awareness. There is no plausible mechanism through which the release of Nicolas Cage films could cause an increase in swimming pool accidents, or vice versa. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this correlation is spurious and due to chance or other unobserved variables."

    "text": "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\nA percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value below which 20% of the observations may be found. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile)\nThere are three types of incomes reported in this data frame: p25th, median, and p75th. These correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the income distribution of sampled individuals for a given major.\n\nWhy do we often choose the median, rather than the mean, to describe the typical income of a group of people?\n\nThe question we want to answer “How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?”. We need to do a few things to answer this question: First, we need to group the data by major_category. Then, we need a way to summarize the distributions of median income within these groups. This decision will depend on the shapes of these distributions. So first, we need to visualize the data.\nLet’s start simple and take a look at the distribution of all median incomes, without considering the major categories. Create a hishogram. Consider the binwidth we chose for our histogram. It’s good practice to always think in the context of the data and try out a few binwidths before settling on a binwidth. You might ask yourself: “What would be a meaningful difference in median incomes?” $1 is obviously too little, $10000 might be too high.\n\nTry binwidths of $1000 and $5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice.\nPlot the distribution of median income using a histogram, faceted by major_category. Use the binwidth you chose in the earlier exercise.\n\nNow that we’ve seen the shapes of the distributions of median incomes for each major category, we should have a better idea for which summary statistic to use to quantify the typical median income.\n\nWhich major category has the highest typical (you’ll need to decide what this means) median income?\nWhich major category is the least popular in this sample?"

Your output should only show the major name and median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile earning for that major as and should be sorted such that the major with the highest median earning is on top."

What can you say about how the continents compare to each other in terms of their plastic waste per capita? The answer:With the histogram, it is possible to observe differences in the per capita distribution of plastic waste across continents. For example, Africa shows a higher peak waste output and North America shows a wider distribution.\n\n# Create histograms faceted by continent\np_histogram = ggplot(df_clean, aes(x='plastic_waste_per_cap')) + \\\n    geom_histogram(bins=30, fill='blue', color='black', alpha=0.7) + \\\n    facet_wrap('continent') + \\\n    ggtitle('Distribution of Plastic Waste per Capita by Continent') + \\\n    xlab('Plastic Waste per Capita') + \\\n    ylab('Frequency')\n\n\np_histogram.show()\n\n   \n   \n\n\nQuenstion2:Convert your side-by-side box plots from the previous task to violin plots.

You will need to make two separate plots. Do either of these pairs of variables appear to be more strongly linearly associated? The answer:The visualization of the relationship between the two demographic variables shows the association between plastic waste per capita and total population and coastal population.

    "text": "This chapter will take you through some of the essential parts of a Python workflow.\nPrerequisites You’ll need an installation of Python and Visual Studio Code with the Python extensions to get to grips with this chapter. If you haven’t installed those yet, head back to {ref}code-preliminaries and follow the instructions there.\nWorking with Python scripts and the interactive window As a reminder, the figure below shows the typical layout of Visual Studio Code.\nA typical user view in Visual Studio Code\nWhen you create a new script (File-&gt;New File-&gt;Save as ’your_script_name.py), it will appear in the part of the screen labelled as 3.\nTo run a script, select the code you want to run, right click, and select “Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window”. You can also hit shift + enter if you set this shortcut up; if you haven’t it’s well worth doing and you can find the instructions in {ref}code-preliminaries.\nUsing the “Run Selection/Line in Interactive Window” option or using the shortcut will cause panel 5 in the above diagram (the interactive window) to appear, where you will see the code run and the outputs of your script appear.\n{tip} If you have an issue getting the code to run in the interactive window, first check the instructions in {ref}code-preliminaries. If you’re still having issues, it may be that Visual Studio Code isn’t sure which Python to run, or where Python is on your system. To fix the latter problem, hit the “Select kernel” button in the top right-hand side of the interactive window. When you are first writing a script, it’s useful to be able to move back and forth between the script and the interactive window. You might execute a line of code (put the cursor on the relevant line and hit shift and enter) in the interactive window, then manually write out some code in the interactive window’s execution box (seen at the bottom of panel 5 saying “Type code here…”), and then explore some of the variables you’ve created with the variable explorer (using the button “Variables”) at the top of the interactive window.\nBut, once you’ve honed the code in your script, it’s good to make the script a complete analytical process that you are happy running end-to-end and that—for production or ‘final’ work—you would use the “Run Current File in Interactive Window” option to run all the way through. This is good practice because what is in your script is reproducible but what you’ve entered manually in the interactive window is not. And you want the outputs from your code to be reproducible and understandable by others (including future you!), but this is hard if there are undocumented extra lines of code that you only did on the fly via the interactive window’s execution box.\nUsing installed packages and modules We already saw how to install packages in {ref}code-preliminaries. If you forgot, look back at how to do this now. In short, packages are installed using the command line or, on Windows, the Anaconda prompt. With either of these open, type conda install packagename and hit enter to both search for and install the package you need.\nWhat about using a package that you’ve installed? That’s what we’ll look at now.\nLet’s see an example of using the powerful numerical library numpy. There are different ways to import packages to use within a script or notebook; you can import the entire package in one go or just import the functions you need (if you know their names). When an entire package is imported, you can give it any name you like and the convention for numpy is to import it as the shortened ‘np’. All of the functions and methods of the package can be accessed by typing np followed by . and then typing the function name. This convention of importing packages with a given name makes your code easier to read, because you know exactly which package is doing what, and avoids any conflicts when functions from different packages have the same name.\nAs well as demonstrating importing the whole package for numpy, the example below shows importing just one specific function from numpy, inv, which does matrix inversion. Note that because inv was imported separately it can be used without an np prefix.\nimport numpy as np from numpy.linalg import inv\nmatrix = np.array([[4.0, 2.0, 4.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]])\nprint(“Matrix:”) print(matrix)\ninv_mat = inv(matrix) print(“Inverse:”) print(inv_mat) We could have imported all of numpy and it used it without extension using from numpy import * but this is considered bad practice as it fills our ‘namespace’ with function names that might clash with other packages and it’s less easy to read because you don’t know which function came from which package (one of Python’s mantras is “explicit is better than implict”). However, some packages are designed to be used like this, so, for example, you will see from lets_plot import * in this book.\n{note} If you want to check what packages you have installed in your Python environment, run conda list on your computer’s command line (aka the terminal or command prompt). Sometimes you might forget what a function you have imported does! Or at least, you might not be sure what all of the optional arguments are. In Visual Studio Code, you can just hover your cursor over the name of the function and a box will come up that tells you everything you need to know about it. This box is auto-generated by doc-strings; information that is written in text just under a function’s definition (def statement).\nAn alternative way to see what a function does is to use a wonderful package called rich that does many things including providing an inspect() function. You will need to use pip to install rich by running pip install rich on the command line. Here’s an example of using rich’s inpsect method on the inv() function we imported above (methods=True reports all of the functionality of inv()):\nfrom rich import inspect\ninspect(inv, help=True) {admonition} Write a code block that imports the numpy function numpy.linalg.det() as det(). Run inspect() on it. Find the determinant of [[4, 3], [1, 7]]. Modules Sometimes, you will want to call in some code from a different script that you wrote (rather than from a package provided by someone else). Imagine you have several scripts with code in, a, b, and c, all of which need to use the same underlying function that you have written. What do you do? (Note that “script with code in” is just a text file that has a .py extension and contains code.)\nA central tenet of good coding is that you do not repeat yourself. Therefore, a bad solution to this problem would be to copy and paste the same code into all three of the scripts. A good solution is to write the code that’s need just once in a separate ‘utility’ script and have the other scripts import that one function. This also adheres to another important programming principle: that of writing modular code.\nThis schematic shows the kind of situation we’re talking about:\nimport networkx as nx import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib_inline.backend_inline\n\n\n\nplt.style.use( “https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists/raw/main/plot_style.txt” ) matplotlib_inline.backend_inline.set_matplotlib_formats(“svg”)\ngraph = nx.DiGraph() graph.add_edges_from( [ (“Utility script”, “code file a”), (“Utility script”, “code file b”), (“code file a”, “code file c”), (“code file b”, “code file c”), (“Utility script”, “code file c”), ] ) colour_node = “#AFCBFF” fixed_pos = nx.spring_layout(graph, seed=100) nx.draw(graph, pos=fixed_pos, with_labels=True, node_size=6000, node_color=colour_node) extent = 1.4 plt.xlim(-extent, extent) plt.ylim(-extent, extent) plt.show(); How can we give code files a, b, and c access to the functions etc in the “Utility script”? We would define a file ‘utilities.py’ that had the following function in that we would like to use in the other code files:\n\n\n\ndef really_useful_func(number): return number*10 Then, in ‘code_script_a.py’, we would write:\nimport utilities as utils\nprint(utils.really_useful_func(20)) An alternative is to just import the function we want, with the name we want:\nfrom utilities import really_useful_func as ru_fn\nprint(ru_fn(30)) Another important example is the case where you want to run ‘utilities.py’ as a standalone script, but still want to borrow functions from it to run in other scripts. There’s a way to do this. Let’s change utilities.py to\n\n\n\ndef really_useful_func(number): return number*10\ndef default_func(): print(‘Script has run’)\nif name == ‘main’: default_func() What this says is that if we call ‘utilities.py’ from the command line, eg\npython utilities.py It will return Script has run because, by executing the script alone, we are asking for anything in the main block defined at the end of the file to be run. But we can still import anything from utilities into other scripts as before–and in that case it is not the main script, but an import, and so the main block will not be executed by default.\nYou can important several functions at once from a module (aka another script file) like this:\nfrom utilities import really_useful_func, default_func {admonition} Write your own utilities.py that has a super_useful_func that accepts a number and returns the number divided by 10. In another script, main.py, try a) importing all of utilities and running super_useful_func on a number and, b), importing just super_useful_func from utilities and running it on a number. Reading and writing files Although most applications in economics will use the pandas package to read and write tabular data, it’s sometimes useful to know how to read and write arbitrary files using the built-in Python libraries too. To open a file\nopen(‘filename’, mode) where mode could be r for read, a for append, w for write, and x to create a file. Create a file called text_example.txt and write a single line in it, ‘hello world’. To open the file and print the text, use:\nwith open(‘text_example.txt’) as f: text_in = f.read()\nprint(text_in) ‘hello world!’ is the new line character. Now let’s try adding a line to the file:\nwith open(‘text_example.txt’, ‘a’) as f: f.write(‘this is another line’) Writing and reading files using the with command is a quick and convenient shorthand for the less concise open, action, close pattern. For example, the above example can also be written as:\nf = open(‘text_example.txt’, ‘a’) f.write(‘this is another line’) f.close() Although this short example shows opening and writing a text file, this approach can be used to edit a wide range of file extensions including .json, .xml, .csv, .tsv, and many more, including binary files in addition to plain text files."
